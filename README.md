## C++ Playlist Management System

This project showcases a dynamic playlist management system developed in C++. It features dynamic memory allocation using pointers instead of arrays, operator overloading for streamlined object manipulation, and robust file handling for interactive playlist management.

### Key Features
- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Efficiently manages songs and playlists using linked lists to ensure optimal memory usage.
- **Operator Overloading**: Enhances code readability and functionality with custom behavior for song and playlist operations.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Utilizes text-based menus for creating, modifying, loading, and saving playlists, providing a clear and easy-to-use interface.

### Skills Demonstrated
- Advanced C++ programming, including dynamic memory management, class design, and file operations.
- Error handling and input validation to ensure program stability and reliability.
- Developing and maintaining a complex application within a Linux environment.
